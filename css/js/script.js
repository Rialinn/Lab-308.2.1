// =====Part 2: Practical Math=====
// You are planning a cross-country road trip!

// The distance of the trip, in total, is 1,500 miles.
// Your carâ€™s fuel efficiency is as follows:
// At 55 miles per hour, you get 30 miles per gallon.
// At 60 miles per hour, you get 28 miles per gallon.
// At 75 miles per hour, you get 23 miles per gallon.
// You have a fuel budget of $175.
// The average cost of fuel is $3 per gallon.

// Set up a program to answer the following questions:
// You have a fuel budget of $175.
// The average cost of fuel is $3 per gallon.


let g1 = 30
let g2 = 28
let g3 = 23

let t1 = 55
let t2 = 60
let t3 = 75

const totaldist = 1500
const totalbudg = 175
let costOfFuel = 3

const trip1 = totaldist/g1
console.log(t1, 'gallons of gas');

const trip2 = totaldist/g2
console.log(t2, 'gallons of gas');

const trip3 = totaldist/g3
console.log(t3,'gallons of gas');

const trip1FuelCost =  trip1* costOfFuel < totalbudg
console.log(trip1FuelCost);

const trip2FuelCost = trip2* costOfFuel < totalbudg
console.log(trip2FuelCost);

const trip3FuelCost = trip3* costOfFuel < totalbudg
console.log(trip3FuelCost);

const trip1Time = totaldist/t1
console.log(trip1Time);

const trip2Time = totaldist/t2
console.log(trip2Time);













//=======Part 3: Future Exploration===

// In all of the problems above, there are two tools that would make it much easier to implement the logic we need and to reuse the code to test with different values:
// Control flow, which is how we conditionally determine what a program does next. For example, if we exceed our fuel budget, perhaps the program could automatically change the speed it is testing until it finds the optimal speed.
// Functions, which are reusable blocks of code, allow us to run pieces of code multiple times without rewriting the code or changing the value of variables in the code itself, like we needed to do above.
